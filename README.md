# PixelPainter-V.2

There are two goals of this project.

1) Have a color swath and grid that can be dynamically created with at least two buttons (one for erasing a color and one for clearing the entire canvas).

2) Complete this without modifying the index.html file; creating all html markup using the DOM API.
